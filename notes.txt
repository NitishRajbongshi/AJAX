AJAX runs on server side only. So, to run AJAX in the local machine there should be some local server like XAMPP.

How AJAX Works
--------------

1. An event occurs in a web page (the page is loaded, a button is clicked)
2. An XMLHttpRequest object is created by JavaScript
3. The XMLHttpRequest object sends a request to a web server
4. The server processes the request
5. The server sends a response back to the web page
6. The response is read by JavaScript
7. Proper action (like page update) is performed by JavaScript

The XMLHttpRequest Object
-------------------------
All modern browsers support the XMLHttpRequest object.

The XMLHttpRequest object can be used to exchange data with a server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.

The XMLHttpRequest object is used to exchange data with a server.

Send a Request To a Server
To send a request to a server, we use the open() and send() methods of the XMLHttpRequest object:

load() Method:
-------------

Used with jQuery.
The load() method loads data from the server. The return data can be put in a selected DOM.
syntax: $(selector).load(URL, DATA, callback)

open() function:
---------------
The open(method, URL, async) function is used to open an external file, API and display to the web page.
method: GET/POST
url: any url to open
async: true / false

The onreadystatechange Property:
-------------------------------
The readyState property holds the status of the XMLHttpRequest.
The onreadystatechange property defines a function to be executed when the readyState changes.

The status property and the statusText property holds the status of the XMLHttpRequest object.


GET and POST in jQuery
----------------------
HTTP Request: GET vs. POST
Two commonly used methods for a request-response between a client and server are: GET and POST.

GET - Requests data from a specified resource
POST - Submits data be processed to a specified resource
GET is basically used for just getting (retrieving) some data from the server. Note: The GET method may return cached data.

A POST can also be used to get some data from the server. However, the POST method NEVER caches data and is often used to send data along with the request.

jQuery $.get() Method
---------------------
The $.get() method requests data from the server with an HTTP GET request.

Syntax:

$.get(URL,callback);
The required URL parameter specifies the URL you wish to request.

The optional callback parameter is the name of a function to be executed if the request succeeds.

jQuery $.post() Method
----------------------
The $.post() method requests data from the server using an HTTP POST request.

Syntax:

$.post(URL,data,callback);
The required URL parameter specifies the URL you wish to request.

The optional data parameter specifies some data to send along with the request.

The optional callback parameter is the name of a function to be executed if the request succeeds.
