AJAX runs on server side only. So, to run AJAX in the local machine there should be some local server like XAMPP.

How AJAX Works

1. An event occurs in a web page (the page is loaded, a button is clicked)
2. An XMLHttpRequest object is created by JavaScript
3. The XMLHttpRequest object sends a request to a web server
4. The server processes the request
5. The server sends a response back to the web page
6. The response is read by JavaScript
7. Proper action (like page update) is performed by JavaScript

The XMLHttpRequest Object
All modern browsers support the XMLHttpRequest object.

The XMLHttpRequest object can be used to exchange data with a server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.

The XMLHttpRequest object is used to exchange data with a server.

Send a Request To a Server
To send a request to a server, we use the open() and send() methods of the XMLHttpRequest object:

load() Method: 

Used with jQuery.
The load() method loads data from the server. The return data can be put in a selected DOM.
syntax: $(selector).load(URL, DATA, callback)

open() function:
The open(method, URL, async) function is used to open an external file, API and display to the web page.
method: GET/POST
url: any url to open
async: true / false

The onreadystatechange Property:
The readyState property holds the status of the XMLHttpRequest.
The onreadystatechange property defines a function to be executed when the readyState changes.

The status property and the statusText property holds the status of the XMLHttpRequest object.
